# Analysis_Police_Killings
GA Final Project
by Thomas Bilach

As part of my final project, I wanted to investigate the contextual factors affecting police use-of-force decisions in the field. I downloaded a dataset from the The Guardian's webpage, which includes all "reported" police killings in 2015. I will use this dataset to investigate the following:

- The demographic composition of decedents;
- The threat-level imposed upon officers at the time of the suspect's death;
- The agencies and U.S. states with the most police shootings per capita. 

Given mainstream media accounts of police shootings, it would appear African American males are over-represented among those killed by the police. This assumption is largely a function of the widespread media coverage of high-profile police shootings. Does reporting on police shootins comport with the largest publicly available statistics? To answer these questions, I wanted to assess differences across many different demographic variables and whether this comports with what the mainstream media portrays on television.
